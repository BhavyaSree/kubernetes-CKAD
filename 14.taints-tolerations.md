Taints and tolerations have nothing to do with security or intrusion on the cluster.  

Taints are toleration are used to set restrictions on what pods can be shared on that node.  

When the PODS are created, kubernetes scheduler tries to place these pods on the available worker nodes.  
As of now, there are no restrictions or limitations and so scheduler places the PODs across all of the nodes to balance them out equally.  

Let us assume, we have dedicated resources on node1 for a particular usecase.
